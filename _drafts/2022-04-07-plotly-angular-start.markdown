title: "Plotly in Angular: The Beginning"
---

I love PlotlyJS. Let's see how to set it up with Angular. We will be using [angular-plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/angular-plotly.js/) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-plotly.js/v/0.1.13)) to incorporate the PlotlyJS library into the Angular framework. If you're unfamiliar with Angular checkout their [website](https://angular.io). There is a lot of useful information about Angular and how to set it up and get familiar with it. Make sure you have Node.js installed and can use the `npm` and the `ng` commands. You can verify this by simply running `npm --help` and `ng --help`.

Let create our new Angular project. I will name it 'the-beginning', but you can name it whatever you feel will be a good name. Run the command `ng new the-beginning`. You will be asked two questions: Would you like to add Angular routing? Which stylesheet format would you like to use?. The details of what these questions are asking is a little beyond what I'll discuss today. For my project I selected Yes use Angular routing and the SCSS stylesheet format.
